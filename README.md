# Tamil-Handwritten-OCR
OCR system for digitizing handwritten Tamil text and translating printed English documents to Tamil using AI-driven models and NLP techniques.

# üìú AI-Based OCR Solution for Digitizing and Translating Handwritten Tamil Documents

An AI-driven Optical Character Recognition (OCR) platform designed to convert handwritten Tamil text from scanned images into digital format, with an optional translation feature for printed English text into Tamil. The system integrates a custom-trained CRNN model, pretrained OCR frameworks, and advanced NLP-based post-processing for clean, accurate text extraction.
